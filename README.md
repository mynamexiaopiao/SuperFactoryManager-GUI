# Super Factory Manager — Visual GUI (SFM-GUI)

A node / wire based **visual program editor** for the Minecraft mod
[Super Factory Manager (SFM)](https://github.com/TeamDman/SuperFactoryManager).
Build factory programs by dragging nodes and wiring them together instead of
writing SFML (Super Factory Manager Language) by hand.

> 一个为 [Super Factory Manager](https://github.com/TeamDman/SuperFactoryManager)
> 打造的**节点/连线式可视化编程界面**。通过拖拽节点、连线来搭建工厂程序，
> 而不必手写 SFML 代码。

- **Minecraft**: 1.21.1
- **Mod loader**: NeoForge 21.1.206
- **Requires**: Super Factory Manager (installed alongside this addon)

---

## Features / 功能

- Classic *Steve's Factory Manager* styled node canvas (pan / zoom).
- Trigger, Input, Output, If, Forget and Raw statement nodes.
- Series (chain) wiring between statements.
- Searchable resource picker with item icons, fluids and Mekanism chemicals.
- Pinyin-aware search (中文拼音搜索) via the bundled
  [PinIn](https://github.com/Towdium/PinIn) library.
- Live SFML preview with syntax highlighting (reuses SFM's own highlighter).
- Round-trips to plain SFML, so programs stay compatible with SFM.

## Attribution & Sources / 参考来源

This project stands on the shoulders of two prior works and is **not** an
original factory-automation design:

### 1. Super Factory Manager (SFM) — TeamDman
- Repository: <https://github.com/TeamDman/SuperFactoryManager>
- Author: **TeamDman**
- License: **Mozilla Public License 2.0**

This addon is built **on top of** SFM. It compiles and runs against SFM's public
API, reuses SFM's SFML parser / AST, program packet, label handling and syntax
highlighter, and produces standard SFML programs that SFM executes. All of the
factory-automation logic, the SFML language, and the underlying manager belong to
SFM. This project only adds a visual editing front-end.

### 2. Steve's Factory Manager (SFM's own inspiration)
- The classic *Steve's Factory Manager* (originally by **Vswe**, and the
  *ModJam3* / community reimplementations) is the visual node-editor design that
  both SFM and this GUI take inspiration from.
- The node-canvas look and feel here (frames, menu strips, connection nubs, the
  `flow_components` sprite layout) are ported from the classic *Steve's Factory
  Manager / ModJam3* UI.

If you enjoy this addon, please support the original **Super Factory Manager** and
the authors of **Steve's Factory Manager**.

## Building / 构建

Requires JDK 21.

```bash
./gradlew build        # compile + run tests, produces build/libs/*.jar
./gradlew jarJar       # produces the distributable jar with PinIn bundled (-all.jar)
```

The build depends on an SFM jar placed at `libs/sfm-4.34.0.jar` (see
`gradle.properties` → `sfm_jar`), and on the Mekanism API (compile-only, for
chemical resource icons).

## Usage / 使用

1. Install NeoForge 1.21.1, Super Factory Manager, and this addon.
2. Open an SFM Manager, then open the visual editor from the manager screen.
3. Drag nodes from the left toolbar, wire them, and save — the program is written
   back as SFML that SFM runs.
